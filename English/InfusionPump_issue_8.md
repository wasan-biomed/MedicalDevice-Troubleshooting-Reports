# Incident Report – Syringe Infusion Pump (B. Braun Perfusor Space)

- Incident Date: 2024-06-05  
- Device: Syringe Infusion Pump – B. Braun Perfusor Space  
- Serial Number: IP-309456-B  
- Department: Neonatal Unit – Incubator 4

---

## Problem Description

The pump repeatedly displayed the message “Occlusion” a few minutes after starting,  
despite the line being open and fluid visibly flowing.

---

## Initial Inspection

- The syringe and infusion line were replaced entirely → same alarm persisted  
- The same syringe was tested on another pump → no alarm triggered  
- Pressure settings were checked → set to appropriate low level

---

## Root Cause Analysis

It was found that the **internal pressure sensor** was **malfunctioning**,  
generating a **false high-pressure reading** even though the line was not obstructed.

---

## Corrective Action Taken

- The device was opened, and the faulty pressure sensor was replaced with a spare  
- The pressure alarm system was **recalibrated**  
- A test was performed using a dummy line → no alarm occurred  
- The intervention was documented in the device maintenance log

---

## Preventive Action

- Included **pressure testing** as part of the **Pre-Use Checklist** for nursing staff  
- Requested supply of **spare pressure sensors** for future maintenance
