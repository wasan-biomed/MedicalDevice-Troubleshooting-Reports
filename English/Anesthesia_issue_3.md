##  Problem Description

While preparing the device before surgery, the anesthesiologist noticed that the oxygen flow level was not displayed on the control screen, even though the oxygen cylinder was full.

---

##  Initial Inspection

-  Oxygen hose was replaced → issue persisted  
-  Oxygen valve was verified → fully opened

---

##  Root Cause Analysis

Upon internal inspection, a **partial blockage** was found in the **oxygen flow control valve**, caused by **fine oily residue**, most likely due to contamination during a previous cylinder replacement.

---

##  Corrective Action Taken

- The flow control unit was disassembled and the affected valve inspected  
- The valve was cleaned using a medical-grade safe cleaning solution  
- Reassembled the unit and performed a gas flow test → readings were normal  
- Full device check was completed using Pre-op Check procedure

##  Preventive Action

- Staff responsible for cylinder replacement were retrained to use clean, dry tools  
- Internal visual inspection of valves added to preventive maintenance checklist  
- Recommendation issued to use **micro filters** at the cylinder inlet
