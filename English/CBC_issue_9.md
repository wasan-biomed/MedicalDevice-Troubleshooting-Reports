## Problem Description

When attempting to analyze a blood sample, the device displayed the error:  
**“Error: No aspiration”**  
and failed to aspirate blood from the sample tube.

## Initial Inspection

- Sample tube was properly positioned → confirmed  
- A new sample was tested → same error occurred
