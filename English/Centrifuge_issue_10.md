# Incident Report – Laboratory Centrifuge (Hettich EBA 200)

- Incident Date: 2024-07-01  
- Device: Laboratory Centrifuge – Hettich EBA 200  
- Serial Number: CF-778341-D  
- Department: Clinical Chemistry Laboratory – First Floor

---

## Problem Description

Upon starting the device, it begins to spin for a few seconds and then stops automatically,  
displaying the message:  
**"Imbalance Detected"**  
even though the tubes were placed symmetrically and balanced inside the rotor.

---

## Initial Inspection

- Confirmed that the number of tubes was even and weight was evenly distributed → ✅  
- Same tubes tested on another centrifuge → functioned normally  
- No excessive vibration was observed during startup

---

## Root Cause Analysis

Inspection revealed that the **imbalance sensor** had become overly sensitive  
due to a **slightly dislodged mount**, likely caused by the device **falling**  
during cleaning procedures in the lab the previous week.

---

## Fix Applied

- Opened the device and accessed the imbalance sensor unit  
- Re-secured and repositioned the sensor mount properly  
- Conducted a test run with 4 balanced tubes → no alarms triggered  
- Logged the event in the laboratory maintenance records

---

## Preventive Action

- Installed additional **rubber dampers** underneath the device to reduce shock  
- Instructed cleaning staff on safe handling of sensitive lab devices  
- Added imbalance sensor check to the **monthly preventive maintenance schedule**
